Luminate Online Page Editor - Shared Library
============================================

[luminateEdit.js](https://github.com/noahcooper/luminateEdit/blob/master/shared/src/luminateEdit.js) is the core 
of the extension. The library is browser-agnostic -- it's primary function is to return the administrative URL 
for a given constituent-facing URL. Each browser extension extends the luminateEdit object with its own unique 
methods.
